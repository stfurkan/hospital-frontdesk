## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set up Environment

The `.env` file should contain:

```env
DATABASE_URL=
DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN=
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=
SESSION_SECRET=
```

### 3. Initialize Database

```bash
npm run db:push    # Create tables
npm run db:seed    # Seed initial data
```

### 4. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and login with:

- **Admin**: `admin` / `admin123`
- **Receptionist**: `resepsiyon` / `receptionist123`

## 🔐 Default Users

After seeding, two users are available:

1. **Administrator**

   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
   - Role: Admin

2. **Receptionist**
   - Username: `resepsiyon`
   - Password: `receptionist123`
   - Role: Receptionist

## 📋 Sample Data

The seed script creates:

- 3 departments (Cardiology, Neurology, Orthopedics)
- 3 doctors (one per department)
- 1 test patient (T.C.: 34910186844)
- 5 services (General exam, ECG, Blood test, X-Ray, MRI)

## 🎯 Features Highlights

### Appointment Locking (Redis)

- Uses Redis to lock appointment slots during booking
- Prevents race conditions and double bookings
- Falls back gracefully if Redis is not configured (for local dev)
- 30-second lock duration during booking process

### Financial Tracking

- Automatically calculates service totals per visit
- Tracks all payments with methods and notes
- Shows remaining balance per patient
- Comprehensive financial summary in patient lookup

### Type Safety

- Full TypeScript coverage
- Drizzle ORM with inferred types
- Type-safe server actions
- No `any` types in production code

### User Experience

- Toast notifications for all actions
- Loading states
- Form validation
- Responsive design
- Turkish language support
- Modern, clean UI

## 📊 Database Schema

8 main tables:

1. `users` - Staff/admin accounts
2. `departments` - Hospital departments
3. `doctors` - Doctor profiles
4. `patients` - Patient records
5. `appointments` - Scheduled appointments
6. `visits` - Patient check-ins
7. `visit_services` - Services added to visits
8. `services` - Medical services catalog
9. `payments` - Payment records

## 🔧 Database Commands

```bash
npm run db:push      # Push schema to database
npm run db:generate  # Generate migrations
npm run db:migrate   # Run migrations
npm run db:studio    # Open Drizzle Studio
npm run db:seed      # Seed database
```

## 🌐 Production Deployment

### Turso Setup (Recommended)

1. Sign up at [turso.tech](https://turso.tech)
2. Create a database
3. Update `.env` with your Turso credentials:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=libsql://your-db.turso.io
   DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token
   ```

### Upstash Redis (Optional but Recommended)

1. Sign up at [upstash.com](https://upstash.com)
2. Create a Redis database
3. Add credentials to `.env`:

   ```env
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-redis.upstash.io
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your-token
   ```

### Security for Production

1. Change `SESSION_SECRET` to a strong random string
2. Enable HTTPS
3. Set secure cookie flags
4. Review and update password policies
5. Consider rate limiting

## 🎨 UI Components

All UI components are from **Shadcn/ui** (New York style):

- Button, Input, Label, Textarea
- Card, Table, Badge
- Dialog, AlertDialog
- Select, Tabs, Separator
- Toast notifications via Sonner
- Dropdown menus, Popovers

## ✨ Best Practices Implemented

- ✅ Server Components by default
- ✅ Server Actions for mutations
- ✅ Optimistic updates with revalidation
- ✅ HTTP-only cookies for sessions
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ SQL injection protection via Drizzle
- ✅ Type-safe queries
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Accessibility considerations
- ✅ Clean code structure

## 🐛 Known Considerations

- Redis is optional for local development (falls back gracefully)
- Date/time inputs use native browser controls
- No email verification (out of scope)
- No SMS notifications (out of scope)
- Basic role system (can be extended)
